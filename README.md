# BearMarketFollowThroughs
Python Script for Identification and Visualization of Follow-Through Rallies during Bear Markets

* Follow-through rallies during bear markets are often a good indicator of the early beginnings of a bull market.
* A self-explanatory script 'main_FollowThrough.py' calls on historical S&P500 (since 1995) data from the financialmodelingprep.com API (subscription req.) and then identifies periods of bear market, bear market rallies, and follow-through rallies.
* The data is then exported to 'S&PHistoricalWithBear.xlsx' which is linked with the PowerBI file 'Analysis.pbix' for the visualization of the data as shown below:
